# Machine Learning Homework - Exoplanet Exploration

## Background

Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.

To help process this data, I created machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.

### Preprocessed & Cleaned the Data

* Data was first read in from a csv file, and null columns and null rolls were dropped. 
* Performed feature selection and remove unnecessary features.
* Used `ExtraTreesClassifier()` and stored those top ten features as a series to be used as my `X` values. 
* The `koi_disposition` column contained the classification values of each exoplanet candidate and would be used as my `y` values.
* Used `MinMaxScaler` to scale the numerical data.
* Separated the data into training and testing data.`train_test_split` 
* This process and method was used for all four models.

### Tuned Model Parameters

* Used `GridSearch` to tune model parameters.
